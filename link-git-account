Generating a new SSH key
Open Git Bash.

Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.

$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Note: If you are using a legacy system that doesn't support the Ed25519 algorithm, use:

$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.

At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. For more information, see "Working with SSH key passphrases".
